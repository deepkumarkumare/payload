To use Payload with MongoDB, install the package `@payloadcms/db-mongodb`. It will come with everything you need to
store your Payload data in MongoDB.

Then from there, pass it to your Payload Config as follows:

```ts
import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'

export default buildConfig({
  // Your config goes here
  collections: [
    // Collections go here
  ],
  // Configure the Mongoose adapter here
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    // Mongoose-specific arguments go here.
    // URL is required.
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URI,
  }),
})
```

## Adding the MongoDB URI
When using Payload with MongoDB, the ``DATABASE_URI`` must be configured to point to your MongoDB database. This URI can either be set during the installation or defined in the ``.env`` file in your project folder.

Payload supports Mongoose as the MongoDB adapter, making it easy to manage MongoDB connections efficiently. 

### **Ways to Set the MongoDB URI**

***1. Locally***

To connect to a locally hosted MongoDB instance, use the following URI format in your `.env` file:

```ts
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/payload
```

- `localhost` refers to your local machine.
- `27017` is the default MongoDB port.
- `payload` is the name of the database [you can change this as needed].

***2. MongoDB Atlas***

To connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster:

1. Create an Atlas Cluster:
- Sign in to MongoDB Atlas.
- Create a new cluster.

2. Get the Connection String:
- In the Atlas dashboard, go to Database Deployments and click "Get connection string".
- Copy the provided connection string, which should look like this:
```ts
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<app-name>
```
- Replace the placeholders:
  - `<username>` : Your MongoDB Atlas username.
  - `<password>` : Your MongoDB Atlas password (URL-encoded if it contains special characters).
  - `<database-name>` : The name of your database.
  - `<app-name>` : The name of your application (optional).

  Note on Password Encoding

  If your password contains special symbols, they must be replaced with their URL-encoded equivalents. Below is a reference table for common symbols:

| Symbol                      | URL Encoded Value                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |  
| @                           | %40                               |

## Options

| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `autoPluralization`        | Tell Mongoose to auto-pluralize any collection names if it encounters any singular words used as collection `slug`s.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `connectOptions`           | Customize MongoDB connection options. Payload will connect to your MongoDB database using default options which you can override and extend to include all the [options](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#options) available to mongoose.                                                        |
| `collectionsSchemaOptions` | Customize Mongoose schema options for collections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `disableIndexHints`        | Set to true to disable hinting to MongoDB to use 'id' as index. This is currently done when counting documents for pagination, as it increases the speed of the count function used in that query. Disabling this optimization might fix some problems with AWS DocumentDB. Defaults to false                |
| `migrationDir`             | Customize the directory that migrations are stored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `transactionOptions`       | An object with configuration properties used in [transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/) or `false` which will disable the use of transactions.                                                                                                                                |
| `collation`                | Enable language-specific string comparison with customizable options. Available on MongoDB 3.4+. Defaults locale to "en". Example: `{ strength: 3 }`. For a full list of collation options and their definitions, see the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation/). |

## Access to Mongoose models

After Payload is initialized, this adapter exposes all of your Mongoose models and they are available for you to work
with directly.

You can access Mongoose models as follows:

- Collection models - `payload.db.collections[myCollectionSlug]`
- Globals model - `payload.db.globals`
- Versions model (both collections and globals) - `payload.db.versions[myEntitySlug]`
